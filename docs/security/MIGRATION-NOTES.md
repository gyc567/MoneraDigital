# MoneraDigital — Database Migration System (C-2 Rebuild Notes)

**Audit reference:** C-2 (two parallel migration tracking tables, dead runner)
**Date applied:** 2026-06-05
**Owner:** Platform / Backend

This document is the operational handbook for the rebuilt Go migration
runner. It explains what changed, why, and how to verify production state
going forward.

---

## 1. What was wrong

Before 2026-06-05, the migration system was in a fully-dead state:

| Component | Symptom | Root cause |
|---|---|---|
| `cmd/migrate/main.go` | `go build` reported "build constraints exclude all Go files" | File had `//go:build ignore` |
| `internal/migration/migrations/00046.sql` | Never executed | Runner was dead |
| `internal/migration/migrations/00047.sql` | Never executed, and would mass-reset ACTIVE users if it ever ran | Runner was dead + the file was destructive |
| 9 of 16 Go migration files | Never reached the `migrations` tracking table | The `registerMigrations` list in `cmd/migrate/main.go` only included 6 of 16 (007, 010, 011, 013, 015, 016) |
| `migrations` table | Tracked whatever was registered, so production was inconsistent with source | Same as above |
| `schema_migrations` table | Created by 00046.sql, never used by anything | Dead parallel tracking table |
| `cmd/server/main.go` | Did not call any migration function | Migrations were meant to be a separate step |

In short: **no Go code path actually applied any migration to production**.
Production schema was (per operator) applied by hand via `psql` against the
.SQL files. The Go migration files were aspirational documentation.

## 2. What changed

### 2.1 Runner re-enabled and registered

`cmd/migrate/main.go`:

- Removed the `//go:build ignore` and `// +build ignore` build tags. The
  binary now builds and runs.
- Registered **all 16** Go migrations (the previous list had 6).
- Added `-dry-run` and `-rollback` flags for safer ops.
- All registration is in one `registerMigrations` function so adding a
  new migration is one line, not a re-typing exercise.

### 2.2 New Go migration `046_add_pending_status_and_activation_fields.go`

Replaces the legacy `00046_add_pending_status_and_activation_fields.sql`
with a Go-typed equivalent. Same logical effect:

- Adds `PENDING` value to the `user_status` enum (with `pg_enum` precheck
  for idempotency and PG 12+ transaction safety).
- Adds `activation_code`, `activation_attempts`, `activation_expires_at`,
  `activated_at` columns to `users`.
- Creates the `rate_limits` table used by the in-process rate limiter.
- Creates the three supporting indexes.

All DDL uses `IF NOT EXISTS` (or a `pg_enum` precheck for the enum value),
so re-running against a database where 00046 was applied by hand via
`psql` is a safe no-op.

### 2.3 `.sql` files removed from `internal/migration/migrations/`

`00046_*.sql` and `00047_*.sql` are no longer in the migrations
directory. A CI guard (`scripts/check-secrets.sh`) now fails the build
if any `.sql` reappears in that directory.

### 2.4 `00047` moved to `scripts/archive/sql/00047_2026-04-20_reset_existing_users_to_pending.sql`

`00047` was a one-time destructive data fix (mass `UPDATE users SET
status='PENDING' WHERE status='ACTIVE'`) that should never be a regular
migration. It now lives in `scripts/archive/sql/` with a header block
explaining:

- It is NOT a migration.
- It must NEVER be registered in `cmd/migrate/main.go`.
- The historical context (it was originally going to be applied by
  hand on 2026-04-20).

The file is preserved only as a paper trail. If a future need arises to
re-apply a similar reset, the operator must:

1. Take a fresh `pg_dump` first.
2. Confirm intent with the product owner.
3. Run by hand via `psql` with rotated credentials.
4. Never add it to the `registerMigrations` list.

### 2.5 Migration connection URL (direct vs pooler)

**Business** traffic may use a Neon **pooled** `DATABASE_URL`.

**Migrations** must use a **direct / unpooled** connection so session-level
advisory locks attach to a real backend session (see ADR 0003 / issue #35).

Resolution order for the migrate binary:

1. If `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` is set, use it.
2. Otherwise fall back to `DATABASE_URL` (intended for local direct URLs only).
3. **Stage / production** must set `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` to a direct URL.
4. Reject any migration URL whose hostname contains `-pooler` (case-insensitive).

> **Entrypoint contract:** `cmd/migrate` is the only sanctioned entrypoint for
> production migrate/rollback. Pooler rejection and the stage/production
> dedicated-URL requirement are enforced there (ADR 0003 rule A / config C).
> The library-level `NewMigrator` itself does not re-check the DSN — any
> alternate entrypoint (script, worker) must call `ResolveMigrationDSN` before
> opening a connection, or it silently bypasses those guards.
>
> **DSN form:** `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` / `DATABASE_URL` must be a
> `postgresql://` (or `postgres://`) URL. The libpq keyword/value form
> (`host=... sslmode=...`) is not accepted by the resolver. Neon's default
> connection string is already the URL form, so this only matters if an
> operator hand-translates a DSN.

```bash
# Stage/production (illustrative)
MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://...@ep-xxx....neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require" \
EXPECTED_MIGRATION_CEILING=060 \
./monera-migrate -exact-version 060

# Do NOT point migrations at ep-xxx-pooler....neon.tech
```

### 2.6 Advisory lock to prevent concurrent runs

`internal/migration/migrator.go::Migrate()` and `Rollback()` acquire a
session-level advisory lock (key `8675309`) before any DDL or
`migrations` row insert, and release it via `defer`. Two concurrent
invocations (e.g., a deploy step racing a local ops run) serialise
instead of interleaving DDL with row inserts.

**Bounded wait (ADR 0003):** lock acquisition must not block forever.
Default timeout is **30s** (`MIGRATION_ADVISORY_LOCK_TIMEOUT` may override).
On timeout the migrate process fails closed. Logs may include lock key and
read-only holder diagnostics (pid / state / age / application_name) without
credentials. Operators—not the migrator—decide whether to terminate a holder.

Manual lookup if needed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE locktype = 'advisory';
```

## 3. How to verify production state

The production schema was historically applied through more than one path, so
its `migrations` provenance may be sparse even when the corresponding tables
and columns already exist. Always inspect the live provenance before choosing
an execution mode:

```bash
# 1. From your local dev box, with the new (rotated) DATABASE_URL:
DATABASE_URL="..." go run ./cmd/migrate -dry-run

# 2. Output shows every registered migration with its applied status.
#    Versions that say "pending" still need to be applied. Versions
#    that say "applied" are already in `migrations` table.

# Do not execute the default all-pending command against a sparse legacy
# provenance history merely because dry-run reports old versions as pending.
```

For the company-fund production cutover, apply only the approved version and
require its immediate predecessor to be recorded before the process opens a
mutation path:

```bash
APP_ENV=production \
EXPECTED_MIGRATION_CEILING=050 \
DATABASE_URL="..." \
go run ./cmd/migrate -exact-version 050
```

For a manual release, repeat with matching values for every version printed by
the artifact's `monera-migrate -print-release-sequence`, in that exact order.
The current artifact prints `061` followed by `062`. Exact mode has these
invariants:

- Only the requested migration is registered and eligible to run.
- `EXPECTED_MIGRATION_CEILING` must equal `-exact-version`.
- `050` requires `049`; every later version requires its immediate predecessor.
- Historical versions below `050`, unknown versions, and rollback combinations
  are rejected.
- Omitting `-exact-version` preserves the existing all-pending behavior for a
  fresh database or an environment with a fully reconciled Go migration history.

The release artifact declares its ordered migration sequence through
`monera-migrate -print-release-sequence`. The standard deploy path verifies that
the final sequence entry equals `expected_migration_ceiling`, then invokes every
entry separately with matching `-exact-version` and
`EXPECTED_MIGRATION_CEILING`. A failure stops the sequence before the new server
is installed. Already-applied entries are skipped through normal migration
provenance, so a partially completed release can safely resume.

Do not make a sparse legacy history look continuous by inserting synthetic
provenance rows. A migration row claims that exact migration ran; hand-applied
or separately generated schema is not equivalent execution evidence.

## 4. Operational model

The Go runner is intended to be a **deploy-pipeline step**, not a
server-startup hook. The server (`cmd/server/main.go`) does NOT call
`migrator.Migrate()` because:

- Long DDL transactions would extend server cold-start latency.
- A failed migration would block every replica from booting.
- Production deploys already have a "run migration" stage.

If you want a startup-time "auto-migrate" hook, do it in
`cmd/server/main.go` behind a `MIGRATE_ON_BOOT=1` opt-in env var so
local dev can use it but prod stays explicit.

## 5. Adding a new migration (checklist)

1. Create `internal/migration/migrations/0NN_description.go`. Follow the
   existing patterns (transactional step functions if multi-statement).
2. Non-controlled migrations use idempotent DDL (`IF NOT EXISTS` / `pg_enum`
   precheck) so re-runs are safe. A `ControlledMigration` may deliberately use
   strict, non-idempotent DDL when all statements and the provenance insert run
   in the same transaction: pre-existing partial objects are then treated as
   schema drift and fail closed instead of being silently accepted. Document
   that exception in the migration and cover its atomic runner contract.
3. Add a descriptor to `migrationRegistry` in `cmd/migrate/main.go`. For a
   controlled production migration, declare its predecessor and exact-deploy
   eligibility.
4. When the migration belongs to the current release, append its version to
   `artifactMigrationReleaseSequence`. The sequence validator rejects unknown,
   non-exact, or non-contiguous entries and derives the artifact ceiling from
   its last entry.
5. Run `go test ./cmd/migrate ./internal/migration/migrations/` — the public
   runner manifest test will fail for duplicate or out-of-order versions.
6. Run `bash scripts/check-secrets.sh` — the migration-runner-integrity
   block will fail if you forgot step 3 or accidentally put a `.sql`
   in the directory.
7. Commit. CI will run the same checks on every push.

## 6. Why we did NOT add `.sql` migration support to the runner

We considered extending `migrator.go` to also load and execute `.sql`
files in `internal/migration/migrations/`. We chose not to, because:

- AGENTS.md says "Go 强制所有数据库访问" (Go mandatory for all DB
  access). SQL-only migrations fight that principle.
- Two tracking systems (Go-managed `migrations` table + SQL-managed
  `schema_migrations` table) caused the original C-2 issue. Re-introducing
  `.sql` execution would risk re-introducing the parallel tracking.
- The CI guard keeps the Go-only invariant honest. The escape hatch
  for one-off destructive scripts is `scripts/archive/sql/`, not the
  migrations directory.

If a future need genuinely requires `.sql` migrations (e.g., bulk data
backfill that is easier to write as SQL), the right path is to write
the SQL as a string inside a Go migration's `Up()` method, not to
loosen the directory invariant.

## 7. Open follow-ups (not blocking C-2 close)

- **006 is missing.** The version sequence goes 005 → 007 with no 006
  in the repo. We do not know why; possibly a deleted migration. The
  Go registry has 16 migrations covering the real schema, and the
  numeric gap does not affect correctness. We chose not to backfill a
  fake 006 — git history would surface what was there.
- **`drizzle/monera_complete_schema.sql`** is still a documentation
  file that may drift from the Go migrations. Per audit M-5, the
  authoritative source is the Go migrations. The Drizzle file should
  either be auto-generated from Go or deleted in a future pass.
- **No SQL test coverage of the 046 DDL.** The existing test pattern
  is sqlmock-based (see `safeheron_migrations_test.go`). For 046, the
  DDL is verified by `go run ./cmd/migrate` against a real DB. A
  follow-up PR can add sqlmock tests if the team prefers that style.

## 8. Origin/main merge reconciliation (2026-06-06)

This handbook was originally written before the local main was pulled
against origin/main, which had 15 additional commits. Those commits
included a hotfix migration registered as version **016** (the
`AccountFrozenBalanceDefault` first-deposit fix from commit `240f7c6`).
That collides with the `CreateFundReports` migration that was sitting
untracked in the local working tree as `016_create_fund_reports.go`.

**Resolution: keep both migrations, renumber the create-fund_reports
migration from 016 to 049.**

### 8.1 What changed in the local file layout

- `internal/migration/migrations/016_create_fund_reports.go` (untracked)
  → renamed to `internal/migration/migrations/049_create_fund_reports.go`
  (now tracked). The `Version()` method returns `"049"` instead of
  `"016"`. The `Description()` string was updated to note the rename.
  The Up()/Down() bodies are byte-identical.
- `internal/migration/migrations/016_account_frozen_balance_default.go`
  (new from origin) is now the slot-016 owner. Registered in
  `cmd/migrate/main.go` immediately after `SafeheronPhase1` (015).
- `registerMigrations()` in `cmd/migrate/main.go` now registers 19
  migrations (was 18): the 16 from C-2 + AccountFrozenBalanceDefault
  (016, from origin) + the renamed CreateFundReports (049).
- `migrations_test.go::TestMigrationOrder` has 19 entries with the
  new ordering: 001-005, 007-015, 016, 046, 047, 048, 049.

### 8.2 What changed in the db-promote tooling

The `scripts/db-promote/` toolkit previously targeted migration 016
as "the fund_reports migration", which was the untracked local file.
After the rename, the toolkit targets 049:

- `inspector/main.go::migrationVersion` constant: `"016"` → `"049"`.
  All preflight/verify/rollback/info subcommands use this constant,
  so they now target the renamed migration.
- `inspector/main.go` now also registers
  `migrations.AccountFrozenBalanceDefault` in its apply list. Without
  this, the 016 hotfix would not be applied when an operator runs
  `02-promote.sh` on a fresh DB.
- All five shell scripts (`01-preflight.sh`, `02-promote.sh`,
  `03-verify.sh`, `04-rollback.sh`, `05-snapshot.sh`) had their
  header comments and `echo` strings updated from "016" to "049".
- The two print statements in preflight that hardcoded "migration
  016" / "016 not yet applied" now use `fmt.Printf("...%s...", migrationVersion)`.

### 8.3 Operator impact

A `02-promote.sh` run on a fresh DB now applies 19 migrations instead
of 18. The two new behaviours to be aware of:

1. **`016_account_frozen_balance_default` adds a DEFAULT to
   `accounts.frozen_balance`.** The migration uses `ADD COLUMN
   ... DEFAULT ...` semantics. If the column already exists without
   a DEFAULT (the prod state before this deploy), the migration
   drops the NOT NULL and re-adds the column with the DEFAULT — this
   is intentional from the origin dev branch and matches the
   `ce7a6a9 fix: FindOrCreateAccountForUpdate 缺少 frozen_balance
   导致入账失败` fix.
2. **`049_create_fund_reports` creates the `fund_reports` and
   `fund_asset_allocations` tables** (and seeds 5 monthly rows + the
   May 2026 allocation snapshot). This was previously "migration 016"
   in the local pre-merge working tree. If your DB has the
   `fund_reports` table already (because someone ran the untracked
   file manually with psql), the migration's `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
   EXISTS` is a no-op and the `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
   won't double-seed.

### 8.4 What does NOT change

- The order in which the migrator applies migrations (still
  version-sorted).
- The C-1/C-2/H-1/H-2/404 fix code (those are independent of this
  renumbering).
- The reversibility table in PRODUCTION-DEPLOY-2026-06-05.md §9.1
  (still accurate: 049 is the only "soft-reversible" migration via
  `04-rollback.sh`; 047 is the only truly-irreversible one; everything
  else is idempotent re-run).
- The 404 fix's pre-condition: `/api/fund/stats` returns 404 on
  pre-migration DBs and 200 on post-049 DBs. The fix is at the
  repository layer (`isUndefinedTable` translating 42P01 to
  `ErrFundNotFound`); the migration's version number is irrelevant
  to that mapping.

## 9. Open follow-ups (not blocking C-2 close)
